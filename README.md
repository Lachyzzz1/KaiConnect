# KaiConnect 

KaiConnect is a concept that our team designed and prototyped over the weekend of the AI Hackathon.

The idea is that there are community food pantries that are monitored by a camera which then gets processed by an AI image classifier to determine the fullness of the pantry, the type of food in it, and the safety of the food inside. This data is then used to generate the most effeective routes for foodbanks to provide food for communities in need.

## Our prototypes

### FridgeClassifier

The FridgeClassifier prototype is a simple ResNet18 AI model that was trained on 100 images of fridges of various fullness. A similar AI could easily be trained on a dataset of captures from the community pantries.

    To use: run fridgeapp.py and open the link, which will open a browser tab with the front end where you can upload a photo of a fridge to classify.

### Map View

This is a prototype for the map and route that will be generated by the AI once the data regarding the food pantries is known.
